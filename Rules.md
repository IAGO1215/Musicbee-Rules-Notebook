## File Structure
### Root Directory
Check Tag: **Genre & Album Artists = Various Artists**

For various artists, create a seperate folder exclusively for this kind of album, either studio album type or complition one, regardless of its genre. 

For genre, divide into four subgroups: classical, early music, ethnic & others. 

### Sub-Directory

#### 1. Various Artists

Check Tag: **Album Artist = Various Artists**

Final Structure: Year - Genre - Album \ Disc-Track# - Artist - Title

#### 2. Classical
Check Tag: **Genre = Classical or Opera or Vocal**

To define a classical album, there are two important attributes: composers & performers. 

For an album dedicated only to one composer, set both display artist and album artist to the composer. Fill the following slots in artist field with performers, original artist with the most important performer of your choice (e.g. the conductor or orchestra for symphony, the vocalist for vocal works).

Final Structure: "Solo-Composer" \ Composer \ Original Artist - Year - Album \ Disc-Track# - Title

For an album dedicated to multiple composers, set album artist to one desired performer (same as original artist choice in the case above), but display artists to their according composer for each track. For original artist tag, leave it blank.

Final Structure: "Multi-Composer" \ Album Artist \ Year - Album \ Disc-Track# - Composer - Title

#### 3. Early Music
Check Tag: **Genre = Antique or Medieval or Early Music"

#### 4. Ethnic
Check Tag: **Genre = Ethnic - xxxx"

#### 5. Others
